# Excursions

This was a project done with Codecademy. I didn't expect to be deploying a site but here it is in all it's glory:

## Brief

The ask was to recreate a website based on a mock and a [redline mock](https://www.uxbeginner.com/glossary/redlining/). For those who aren't familiar with a `redline mock` these are simply images with red text included to assist with understanding the styling requirements.
